# Off-Nominal Book Club
Collecting the best space books.

## What is ONBC?

The Off-Nominal Book Club (ONBC) is a community of space enthusiasts who have come together to share book recommendations and curate a collection of space-themed books. Through the application, members append to books user-specific meta-data such as tags, favourites, ratings, and reviews to build a community consensus about recommendations. In this way, the application can serve relevant books to users looking for their next space-themed read.

ONBC is an extension of the content offerings of the WeMartians Podcast, the Main Engine Cut Off Podcast, and the Off-Nominal Podcast, delivered to you by hosts Jake Robins and Anthony Colangelo,.

The collection is available to browse by anyone in the general public, but adding new books to the collection, or adding user meta-data is restricted to paid members of the Patreon accounts for either [Jake Robins](https://www.patreon.com/wemartians) or [Anthony Colangelo](https://www.patreon.com/meco). Please consider becoming a patron for these to not only support the Off-Nominal Book Club but also their podcast and journalism pursuits. Our joint venture is a content-driven organization that is listener/reader-funded - your support means a lot.
